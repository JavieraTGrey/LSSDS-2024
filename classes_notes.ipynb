But if we change to gaussian sources we can create kernel density histograms, which would tell us more about the data and the uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that as for example, we can use Gaussian Mixed models, with N numbers of gaussians and N numbers of dimensions, but i can make anything with enough gaussians, then we need to penalize the model to avoid overfitting the data. This penalization can be make by BIC (bayesian information criteria) or AIC (Aikake information criterion)\n",

    "Then sometimes, the data tend to cluster itself, so we want models that can find this clustering. KMeans check the distance to centers according to other point of the data, but the edges are not well behave and also outliers are not declared or accounted for. Besides, it is sensitive to initial guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are more methods more adequate for it. Like HDBSCAN. If the model can not find any cluster (theres just 1) this means that the data is just noise, and there ir no clustering, it does not mean anything."
